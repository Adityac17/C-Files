## 📘 Overview
This repository serves as a submission and archive for the C programming concepts covered during **Sprint 1**. 

All codes and logic implementations in this repository are based on the lectures and lab sessions conducted by **Dr. Aarti Pardeshi Ma'am**.

## 🎯 Learning Objectives
The primary focus of Sprint 1 was to master the building blocks of structured programming:
* Understanding the compilation process.
* Mastering Data Types and Operators.
* Implementing Control Structures (Decision making & Loops).
* Writing modular code using basic functions.

## 📂 Code Directory
Here is a list of the key programs included in this repo:

| File Name | Description | Concepts Used |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `01_basics.c` | Input/Output operations | `printf`, `scanf` |
| `02_calculator.c` | Menu-driven calculator | `switch-case` |
| `03_grade_card.c` | Student grading logic | `if-else ladder` |
| `04_patterns.c` | Pyramid/Star patterns | `nested loops` |
| `05_fibonacci.c` | Fibonacci series generation | `loops`, `logic` |
| `06_prime_check.c` | Checking for prime numbers | `math logic` |
